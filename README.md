Equinox remake made with Godot
==============================
This project is a remake of Mikro-Gen's Equinox, a great game that I enjoyed a lot when I was a child.

In this remake you control a droid with the mission of stabilize a nuclear mining complex that can blow in any moment. The droid has the ability to fly and shoot to destroy the entities that are attacking the complex.

The droid is limited to carry one object at a time, some objects are needed to open closed areas, others fill the droid's energy, etc.

There are 8 areas to complete and each area has a time limit.

Good luck.
